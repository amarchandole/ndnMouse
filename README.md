# Documentation

### Overview

It's a secure control interface for a PC over named-data-networking (NDN), using a mobile device! It also has UDP support.

### Current Features

* Mouse control: movement, left click, right click, tap-to-click
* Mouse movement sensitivity and precision settings
* Two-finger scrolling, with inversion and sensitivity settings
* Rudimentary keyboard support (for slideshow control)
* UDP and NDN support
* Security:
	* AES cipher block chaining with random IVs for each message
	* Random salt applied to password
	* Replay attack prevention via sequence number enforcement policy

### Supported Platforms

##### Severs/Producers (phone): 
* Any relatively modern Android phone

##### Clients/Consumers (PC): basically anything that can run [NFD](http://named-data.net/doc/NFD/current/INSTALL.html) and Python3
* Any Linux distribution that can run NFD and Python3 (tested on Ubuntu 16)
* OSX
* Windows (no NFD, so UDP support only)

# How to Use

### Dependencies
* [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (PC)
	* [PyAutoGUI](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) (PC)
	* [pycrypto](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pycrypto) (PC)
	* [PyNDN](https://github.com/named-data/PyNDN2/blob/master/README.md) (PC)
* [NFD](http://named-data.net/doc/NFD/current/) (PC and Android)

### Install

1. Install NFD on your [Android phone](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.named_data.nfd) and the [PC](http://named-data.net/doc/NFD/current/INSTALL.html) on which you want to control the mouse.
1. Compile and install the app using Android Studio on your Android phone.
1. On your PC, install Python3 and pip3. Then install the two Python libraries: PyAutoGUI, pycrypto, and PyNDN.
	1. Python3 and pip3 (to help install Python libraries): `sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip`
	1. On OSX, you may need to install Quartz (a dependency of PyAutoGUI): `sudo pip3 install pyobjc-framework-Quartz`
	1. PyAutoGUI, pycrypto, and PyNDN: `sudo pip3 install pyautogui pycrypto pyndn`

### Running

1. Attach your phone and PC to the same network or wireless access point. WiFi hotspot also works.
1. Make sure NFD is started on both your phone (the server/producer) and your PC (the client/consumer). Use the NFD app to start it on Android. On PC, use `nfd-start`.
1. On your phone, start the server within ndnMouse (you can choose NDN or UDP protocol).
1. On your PC, execute the matching-protocol Python script in the [pc_client](./pc_client) directory. Connect to the IP address that was specified on your phone's ndnMouse start screen. Password is optional, but provides encryption when used (otherwise cleartext).
1. Control :mouse::exclamation:
