        <p>This app requires an internet or cellular connection to communicate 
        with your PC. If a password is used, communication is encrypted via AES
        with cipher block chaining and random IVs for every packet. For added 
        security, a random salt is applied to your password each session.</p>

        <p>No data is ever transmitted back to the developer or any other  third-
        party entity. ndnMouse only transmits its own custom communication
        protocol between the devices you are controlling, and never stores any
        transmitted data or passwords.</p>
